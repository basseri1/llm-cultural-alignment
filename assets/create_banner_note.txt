Note: 

For the project banner image referenced in the README (cultural_alignment_banner.png), 
you would need to create and add your own image file to this directory.

The image should represent the concept of cultural alignment between LLMs and different cultures.
Ideally, it would include visual elements representing:
- Language models/AI
- Cultural frameworks
- Global/cultural diversity

Once created, save it as "cultural_alignment_banner.png" in this directory.

Until then, the image link in the README will show as broken.
